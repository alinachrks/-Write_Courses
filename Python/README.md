Welcome to Python for You, a comprehensive and intensive Python training program designed specifically for non-programmers and specialists from different fields. Our goal is to introduce you to the world of programming and data analysis through hands-on experience and practical applications.

The course is conducted using remote educational technologies and covers the basics of programming, data analysis, and popular Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more. These libraries are widely used in various industries for data processing, visualization, and modeling, making your learning experience relevant and applicable to real-world scenarios.

From April to December 2023, you will have the opportunity to deepen your knowledge and skills through several months of training. The program is designed for students who have no prior programming experience and are seeking to gain new skills in the field of data analysis. To enroll, you must have a bachelor's degree (at least 2nd course), a specialist degree (at least 3rd course), or a magistracy degree not related to the IT field.

With this course, you will not only gain a solid understanding of Python programming but also have the opportunity to put your knowledge into practice through practical assignments and projects. The program is designed to provide you with the tools and skills you need to pursue new careers, solve real-world problems, and stay ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
